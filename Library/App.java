After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings. Now eighteen and emancipated from the system with nowhere to go, Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But an unexpected encounter with a mysterious stranger has her questioning what’s been missing in her life. And when she’s forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it’s worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness."));

Battery electric vehicles (EVs) are the dominant technology, relying on the conversion of alternating current (AC) from the grid to direct current (DC) to charge the traction battery. This process involves power electronic components such as rectifiers and DC/DC converters operating at high switching frequencies in the kHz range. Fast switching is essential to minimize losses and improve efficiency, but it might also generate electromagnetic interferences (EMI). Hence, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing is essential to ensure reliable system operations and to meet international standards. During DC charging, the AC/DC conversion takes place off-board in the charging station, allowing for better cooling and larger components, resulting in increased power transfer, currently up to 350 kW. The EMC requirements for this charging method are outlined in IEC 61851-21-2. This paper presents possible test setups according to this standard. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for measurements not only in controlled laboratories, but also at real charging stations within their specific environments. Therefore, a mobile setup that can be connected to any public DC charging station using a European standard plug CCS-2 (Combined Charging System 2) is introduced and validated. In addition, the emerging concept of Vehicle to Grid (V2G) is gaining prominence. The objective is to leverage electric vehicles as mobile energy storage for grid optimization and stabilization. The proposed test setup also allows to take these operating states into account concerning conducted interference emissions. As the transition to electric mobility progresses, these investigations contribute to ensuring the seamless integration of EVs into the evolving energy landscape."));
        itemList.addItem(new TechnicalPaper(401, "Graph based cooperation strategies for automated vehicles in mixed traffic 2024-01-2982", "In the context of urban smart mobility, vehicles have to communicate with each other, surrounding infrastructure, and other traffic participants. By using Vehicle2X communication, it is possible to exchange the vehicles’ position, driving dynamics data, or driving intention. This concept yields the use for cooperative driving in urban environments. Based on current V2X-communication standards, a methodology for cooperative driving of automated vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios is presented. Initially, all communication participants communicate their dynamic data and planned trajectory, based on which a prioritization is calculated. Therefore, a decentralized cooperation algorithm is introduced. The approach is that every traffic scenario is translatable to a directed graph, based in which a solution for the cooperation problem is computed via an optimization algorithm. This solution is either computed decentralized by various traffic participants, who share and compare their solutions in order to get an optimal one, or centralized by a single computation unit, such as smart infrastructure systems. The cooperation participants negotiate the cooperative driving maneuver via a chain like validation approach, since the communication protocol does not require any handshake by design. Finally, all cooperation participants carry out the optimized and negotiated cooperative driving maneuver. The presented algorithm is validated in a multi-vehicle simulation. Different optimization heuristics are compared, ranging from traditional approaches to machine learning algorithms. The methods' behavior with regard to increasing model complexities is evaluated based on a representative catalogue of scenarios. Finally, the algorithm is validated in a real world proving ground test. These validations show that the introduced methodology provides significantly more efficient cooperation strategies compared to traditional, infrastructure-controlled approaches. Additionally, the presented approach is conflict-free by design."));
        itemList.addItem(new TechnicalPaper(402, "Optimal and Prototype Dimensioning of Electrified Drives for Automated Driving 2024-01-3021", "Electrified drives will change significantly in the wake of the further introduction of automated driving functions. Precise drive dimensioning, taking automated driving into account, opens up further potential in terms of drive operation and efficiency as well as optimal component design. Central element for unlocking the dimensioning potentials is the knowledge about the driving functions and their application. In this paper the implications of automated driving on the drive and component design are discussed. A process and a virtual toolchain for electric drive development from concept optimization to detailed component dimensioning is presented. The process is subdivided into a concept optimization part for finding the optimal drive topology and layout and a detailed prototype dimensioning process, where the final detailed drive dimensioning is carried out. Furthermore. the detailed simulation allows the drive investigation in representative customer operation as well as automated driving functions in terms of a software in the loop simulation. The process is used for the optimal dimensioning of a battery electric vehicle of the D-segment. The work focusses on a highway pilot function, developed at the Institute of Automotive Engineering of the Technische Universität Braunschweig. The optimal drive configuration is later transferred to the prototype dimensioning simulation. The simulation of automated driving function operation is based on a synthetized driving route. In addition, the routes generated in conjunction with a long-term simulation are particularly suitable for determining load spectra, which in turn can be used as test specifications for the strength simulation or endurance testing of the electric drive. Furthermore, the defined routes can be used for the definition of representative cycles applicable for the concept optimization. The results of both processes will be compared and discussed in detail with an emphasis on efficiency, performance and load spectra."));
